# opencode-warp-auth

Warp (the terminal, warp.dev) AI credits as an OpenCode/magpie provider,
through the Warp app's own sign-in. Provider id: `warp`.

Warp's agent mode speaks its own protocol — a protobuf `Request` POSTed to
`https://app.warp.dev/ai/multi-agent` over **HTTP/2**, answered as SSE whose
`data:` lines are base64 protobuf `ResponseEvent`s — and this plugin answers
OpenAI-style chat completions on it, in OpenCode and in magpie.

## Sign in

- **Use the Warp app's sign-in** reads the account the Warp terminal is
  signed in to, using the stable GUI app's native credential store:
  - **Windows:** DPAPI CurrentUser, from
    `%LOCALAPPDATA%\warp\Warp\data\dev.warp.Warp-User` (with the standard
    home-directory fallback when `LOCALAPPDATA` is unset). PowerShell
    runs from its System32 absolute path and decrypts encrypted bytes
    supplied on stdin; file contents are hashed
    to cache decryption safely across file replacements and clock changes.
  - **macOS:** the default Keychain's generic password with service
    `dev.warp.Warp-Stable` and account `User`, read using `/usr/bin/security`.
    macOS may ask you to allow access to this item or unlock the keychain;
    the reader waits up to two minutes for confirmation. Sign in from the
    Mac desktop session: SSH sessions can be denied access even when the
    desktop can read the item. Headless sessions can use a refresh token.
  - **Linux:** Secret Service attributes `service=dev.warp.Warp`, `key=User`,
    read using `secret-tool` (usually provided by `libsecret-tools`). When
    unavailable, the plugin reads Warp's AES-256-GCM disk fallback at
    `$XDG_STATE_HOME/warp-terminal/dev.warp.Warp-User`, or
    `~/.local/state/warp-terminal/dev.warp.Warp-User` when unset.
  The plugin only reads these stores; it never changes Warp's credentials.
- **Warp refresh token** takes a refresh token pasted by hand, for machines
  without the app or an accessible system credential store. The field in
  Warp's stored account is `id_token.refresh_token`. This method works on
  Windows, macOS and Linux and never follows the local app's account.
  It uses one prompt and an automatic OAuth callback, so magpie does not
  ask for an additional API key.

The sign-in is Firebase Auth: the id token lasts an hour, and the plugin
refreshes it itself at `securetoken.googleapis.com` (magpie's `auth.refresh`
renews it ahead of expiry too). Refresh tokens may rotate; the plugin saves
the returned refresh token, or keeps the existing one when none is
returned, and never writes back to Warp's store. Chat, usage, models and
the refresh hook share
one refresh operation. App sign-in only adopts newer credentials belonging
to the original account, and re-reads the app once after a refused refresh
to recover a concurrent rotation. Switching the app to another account
does not switch this plugin's account. Sign-ins created by older plugin
versions keep using their saved refresh token; sign in again to opt into
following the app. Preview, development and TUI credential namespaces are
not auto-selected.

When Google's refresh endpoint is unreachable or temporarily fails, the
plugin retries through Warp's official `app.warp.dev/proxy/token` proxy.
Definitive invalid-token/account-disabled responses are not retried. An
anonymous app account is identified as anonymous; a stored Firebase custom
token is exchanged at Warp's `/proxy/customToken` endpoint, then the
returned refresh token is used for later renewals. These exchanges do not
create a new anonymous account.

## Requests

- Chat completions are turned into one multi-agent conversation whose user
  query carries the whole transcript so far as JSON records (system prompt,
  prior turns, tool call IDs/arguments and their results), since Warp's conversation state lives in
  tasks the client is meant to round-trip whole. Every request therefore
  starts a fresh conversation. There is no server-side prompt cache between
  turns; the trade for not rebuilding Warp's client conversation model.
  JSON preserves record boundaries when content contains role markers.
  This remains a text transcript, so native model role isolation is not
  available and untrusted content still requires normal agent safeguards.
- The agent's tools are declared as one MCP server's tools
  (`mcp_context.servers[].tools`, JSON schema as a protobuf Struct) and
  `supported_tools` is pinned to `CALL_MCP_TOOL`, so the only tool calls
  that come back are calls to those tools — Warp's own shell/file tools are
  never run and never asked for.
- Replies stream as SSE `chat.completion.chunk`s: `AppendToMessageContent`
  with mask `agent_output.text` becomes content deltas,
  `AgentReasoning` becomes `reasoning_content`, tool calls arrive whole
  (`CallMCPTool` args as a Struct → JSON).
- A data-URL image in the last user message rides as one of
  `InputContext.images` (the base64 text itself in the bytes field, as
  Warp's own client sends it); images of earlier turns are gone with the
  text.
- The turn's end maps by reason: `done` → `stop` (or `tool_calls`),
  `max_token_limit` → `length`, `quota_limit` → an error with status 429,
  `context_window_exceeded` → 400, `llm_unavailable` → 503, internal errors
  or missing completion events → 502. Errors before any output use HTTP
  status codes; errors after streamed output use an SSE error. Non-streamed
  partial output never hides an error. Usage reports `total_input_tokens`
  when present; overlapping deprecated per-model totals are not added or
  misreported as input tokens. Output comes from per-request `TokenUsage.output`.
  Public accounts may receive only `context_window_usage`, without exact token
  counts. In that case the plugin derives an approximate input count from that
  fraction and the model's advertised context window, for client context meters.
  The response preserves the upstream fraction in `usage.context_window_usage`
  and marks the derived count in `usage.prompt_tokens_details` with
  `estimated: true` and `source: "warp_context_window_usage"`. Exact input counts
  always take precedence. Derived counts are not billing measurements; output
  remains zero when Warp omits it. A short conversation can still round to 0%.
- OS headers and request context follow the current platform and shell.
  Client version uses `MAGPIE_WARP_CLIENT_VERSION` when set, then Warp's
  own `WARP_CLIENT_VERSION` environment variable (exported in Warp shells).
  Outside Warp, without an override, it falls back to the last tested
  version `v0.2026.09.02.08.27.stable_01`; set the override to your installed
  version if the service retires that fallback.
- HTTP/2 pauses reading at 4 MiB or 512 queued chunks and resumes below
  2 MiB and 256 chunks, so slow callers can receive long answers without
  buffering the entire response. An 8 MiB / 1024 chunk safety cap remains
  for oversized chunks or a source ignoring pause. Individual SSE lines
  are limited to 8 MiB; malformed responses release the connection.

## Models

The `config` hook declares a handful of ids (`auto`, `auto-efficient`,
`auto-genius`, …) for the pre-sign-in list. Signed in, `provider.models`
lists the account's own (~120: the `auto` routers plus every
family-and-effort variant) from the `GetWorkspacesMetadataForUser` GraphQL,
with each model's context window and vision support; cached 10 minutes. A
`reasoning_effort` on a family id picks that effort's variant when the
account has it.

## Usage

magpie's card shows the request allowance
(`GetRequestLimitInfo`: used/limit of the period, when it resets —
monthly on the free plan), and any bonus credits left beside it.

## Not included

- Server-side conversation continuation (`Task.messages` round-trip): the
  transcript carries the history instead.
- Warp's own tools (shell, file edits, computer use): never exposed.
- Web search; images in tool results (only the last user message's
  images ride).
- Several accounts. OpenCode keeps one sign-in per provider.

## Install

Once the package is published to npm:

```sh
magpie plugin add @magpie-community/opencode-warp-auth
magpie plugin login warp
```

For OpenCode, add `@magpie-community/opencode-warp-auth` to the `plugin`
array in `opencode.json`, then run `opencode auth login`.

To try a checkout before publication: `magpie plugin add <this folder>`.
Edits on disk are picked up by toggling the plugin off/on (or restarting
the host).
