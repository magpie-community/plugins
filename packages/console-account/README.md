# OpenCode Console & Go

Sign in to OpenCode Console in a browser and choose the workspace to use in Magpie. This community plugin provides two separate sign-ins:

| Provider | Models |
| --- | --- |
| `opencode-go-account` | OpenCode Go subscription models |
| `opencode-console-account` | OpenCode Console pay-as-you-go models |

The existing Zen Free plugin uses the public free endpoint. This plugin uses your Console account and its workspace's Go allowance or paid credits. Choose the provider that matches how you want the request billed.

## Install and sign in

In Magpie, add the plugin from **Plugins**, then choose browser sign-in for the provider you want. Verify the device code and select the intended workspace. No API key entry is needed.

```sh
magpie plugin add @magpie-community/opencode-console-account-auth
magpie plugin login opencode-go-account
magpie quota
```

Use `magpie plugin login opencode-console-account` for pay-as-you-go. Model names start with the provider ID, for example `opencode-go-account/deepseek-v4.1-flash`.

## Usage

Magpie's Usage page shows the selected workspace, the Go 5-hour, weekly and monthly windows with their reset times, and any readable Console budgets in USD. Console budgets apply to paid usage, including Go Extra Usage paid from credits. They are displayed for Go without blocking requests that are still covered by the subscription.

Budget remaining is the amount left under a spending limit. View prepaid credit balance, renewal status and plan details in your OpenCode Console workspace under **Settings → Billing**. The plugin reads allowances and budgets; wallet balance is only available in [Console billing](https://opencode.ai/docs/console/billing/).

## Credentials and requests

Magpie stores the access and refresh tokens in `plugin-auth.json` and renews them for the selected account through `auth.refresh`. The plugin sends credentials only to `https://opencode.ai` and does not read browser cookies. The package ships OpenCode 1.x and 2.x entry points; hosts that do not call the refresh hook require a new sign-in after expiry.

The plugin uses OpenCode's device authorization with the public `opencode-cli` client ID and sends its own User-Agent. Model discovery reads the public catalog and applies the selected workspace's model settings. An empty settings object makes no changes; explicitly disabled models stay hidden. An invalid catalog leaves Magpie's previous list in place. Inference uses the protocol declared by the model and preserves conversation IDs; a standalone model test gets its own ID.

## Development

```sh
bun test packages/console-account
bun scripts/check.mjs console-account
```

The tests mock OpenCode responses and use synthetic accounts. For upstream changes, see OpenCode's [device authorization](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/cbe71595e1f370ff91b3081872b96bbe56519c41/packages/core/src/plugin/provider/opencode.ts), [usage and budget responses](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/cbe71595e1f370ff91b3081872b96bbe56519c41/packages/core/src/usage-limits.ts), and [workspace configuration](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode/blob/cbe71595e1f370ff91b3081872b96bbe56519c41/packages/core/src/config/plugin/provider.ts). The bundled catalog snapshots come from OpenCode's public model endpoints. The OpenCode icon's MIT notice is in `assets/LICENSE-opencode.txt`.

## 中文
