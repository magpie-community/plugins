//
// Antigravity answers a 429 "Resource has been exhausted" to a request whose
// system prompt has one of these lines, whatever quota is left, and lets the
// same prompt through reworded. agy-cli hands the client's system prompt to
// agy (session instructions, or <external_system_instructions> in the
// prompt), and agy sends it to Antigravity as written, so it is reworded
// here before it goes. What the bridge keys sessions on (instructionsIdentity) is the
// prompt as the client wrote it.

// TURNED_AWAY are the lines, lower-cased, Antigravity answers a 429 to
// whatever quota is left. Each goes as SAID_AS says instead. The last four
// are turned away since the evening of 11-14 (Lmohn39 and ZhouYimingsjtu on
// X), each 3 of 3 or 5 of 5 on a real account, on gemini-3-flash and
// claude-sonnet-4-6 alike:
//   - "You are Hermes Agent": Hermes' current persona ("You are Hermes
//     Agent, built by Nous Research.") and its earlier one, and the earlier
//     one as magpie reworded it up to 0.1.15 ("… built by Nous Research").
//     The earlier one ("…, an intelligent AI assistant created by Nous
//     Research.") is turned away as "You're Hermes Agent, …" too, 3 of 3,
//     so its "created by" goes "built by" as before as well.
//   - "You are OpenCode", whichever of OpenCode 2.0.25's lines follows it
//     ("a coding agent that helps users…", "an interactive CLI tool…", "the
//     best coding agent on the planet").
//   - "You are a coding agent running in the Codex CLI", Codex's prompt for
//     a model it has no prompt of its own for (Codex 0.165).
//   - "a coding assistant running inside pi", pi 1.5.0's default prompt
//     ("You are a coding assistant running inside pi, a coding agent
//     harness."), as "agent" for "assistant" and "that runs inside pi" are.
// Codex's prompt for GPT-6 ("You are Codex, an agent based on GPT-6."),
// Claude Code's, Gemini CLI's, Qwen Code's, Cline's, Kilo's, goose's, Amp's,
// Droid's, Kimi CLI's, Aider's and Cursor's went through as written.
